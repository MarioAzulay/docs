# API Overview

The IZI Link API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.izilink.com/v1/
```

## Authentication

The IZI Link API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [IZI Link Dashboard](https://app.izilink.com/settings/api-keys).

Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Bearer Authentication. Provide your API key as the bearer token value in the Authorization header.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Learn more about [authentication](/authentication).

## Request/Response Format

### Content Type

All requests should include the `Content-Type: application/json` header, and request bodies should be valid JSON.

### Pagination

List API methods return a paginated list of objects. The response includes:

- `data`: An array of objects
- `has_more`: A boolean indicating if there are more objects
- `total_count`: The total number of objects available
- `next_page_token`: A token to fetch the next page

To fetch the next page, include the `page_token` parameter in your request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://api.izilink.com/v1/payments?page_token=next_page_token" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Error Handling

The IZI Link API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request:

- `2xx`: Success
- `4xx`: Client error (e.g., invalid request)
- `5xx`: Server error

Error responses include a JSON object with the following properties:

- `error`: An object containing:
  - `type`: A string representing the error type
  - `code`: A string representing the error code
  - `message`: A human-readable message providing more details
  - `param`: The parameter that caused the error (if applicable)

Example error response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "parameter_missing",
    "message": "Missing required parameter: amount",
    "param": "amount"
  }
}
```

## Rate Limits

The IZI Link API has rate limits to protect against abuse. Current limits are:

- 100 requests per minute for test mode
- 1000 requests per minute for live mode

If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Versioning

The IZI Link API is versioned. The current version is `v1`. We recommend specifying a version in the URL to ensure compatibility.

## API Playground

You can test our API endpoints directly in our documentation using the API Playground. Look for the "Try It" button on API reference pages.

<Note>
  The API Playground uses your actual API keys, so any actions you take will affect your account. We recommend using test mode keys.
