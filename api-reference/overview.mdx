# Introduction to IZI Pay API

The IZI Pay API is a RESTful service designed for secure and efficient payment processing. It offers predictable resource-oriented URLs, JSON-encoded request and response bodies, and standard HTTP methods and response codes.

## Base URLs

The API supports both production and sandbox environments:

- **Production:** `https://api.izipay.ao`
- **Sandbox:** `https://api-sandbox.izipay.ao`

## Authentication

The IZI Pay API uses HMAC-based authentication. Each application (client) is assigned an `AppId` (client ID) and `AppSecret` (client secret).

<Warning>
    These credentials must be securely stored and never exposed in public repositories!
</Warning>

### HMAC Signature Generation

Authentication is done by generating an HMAC signature using the following components:

```plaintext
AppId + HTTP method + Nonce + URI + UNIX Timestamp + base64 MD5 of payload
```

This signature is then hashed using SHA256 and sent in the `Authorization` header:

```plaintext
Authorization: ApiKey AppId:hash:nonce:timestamp
```

## API Response Codes

The API follows standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request:

| Status Code                 | Meaning                                       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `200 OK`                    | Successful request                            |
| `201 Created`               | Resource successfully created                 |
| `204 No Content`            | Resource modified or deleted                  |
| `400 Bad Request`           | Invalid request syntax                        |
| `401 Unauthorized`          | Invalid credentials or missing authorization  |
| `402 Payment Required`      | Delinquent account                            |
| `403 Forbidden`             | Access denied                                 |
| `404 Not Found`             | Resource does not exist                       |
| `422 Unprocessable Entity`  | Invalid parameters or business rule violation |
| `429 Too Many Requests`     | Rate limit exceeded                           |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | API failure                                   |

## Rate Limits

To prevent abuse, the API enforces rate limits:

- **Test Mode:** 100 requests per minute
- **Live Mode:** 1000 requests per minute

<Warning>
    Exceeding these limits results in a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
</Warning>

## Available APIs

The IZI Pay API provides multiple endpoints for managing payments and transactions:
