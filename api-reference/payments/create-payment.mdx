## Webhooks

When a payment's status changes, IZI Link sends a webhook event. You can use these events to update your application's state.

Relevant events:

- `payment.created`: A payment was created
- `payment.succeeded`: A payment was successful
- `payment.failed`: A payment failed
- `payment.canceled`: A payment was canceled
