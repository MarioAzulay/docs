## API Versioning

We continuously improve our APIs to provide better functionality and security. Some changes may not always be backward compatible, so we use versioning to ensure smooth transitions. For versioning purposes, only removal of a non-optional field or alteration of an existing field will be considered incompatible changes. Your implementation should gracefully handle additional fields you do not expect.

## Authentication

All API requests to IZI Pay require proper authentication credentials. We implement API key authentication to secure all requests. You can manage your API keys through the [IZI Pay Merchant Portal](https://portal.izipay.ao).

### Generating Authentication Hash

The hash is a data string of parameter names and values in alphabetical order. The HMAC hashing algorithm used is SHA256. Here's an example of how to generate the hash:

```javascript
// Example hash generation in JavaScript
const Crypto_JS = require('crypto-js');
const date = Date.now(); // Current date in milliseconds
const fields = {
  time: date, // current date
  vid: 'your_merchant_id', // your merchant ID
};

// Format dataString as key-value pairs in alphabetical order
const dataString = `time=${fields.time}&vid=${fields.vid}`;
const hashKey = 'your_security_key'; // provided during account registration
const hash = Crypto_JS.HmacSHA256(dataString, hashKey).toString(Crypto_JS.enc.Hex);

// Add the generated hash to the fields
fields.hash = hash;
```

### API Request Example

```bash
# Example API request with authentication
curl -X GET \
  https://api.izipay.com/v1/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
