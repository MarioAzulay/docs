# Authentication & Authorization

All API requests to IZI Pay require authentication. We use API keys to authenticate requests. This guide explains how to obtain and use your API keys.

## API Keys

IZI Pay provides two types of API keys:

- **Test Keys**: Use these for development and testing. Transactions made with test keys don't process real payments.
- **Live Keys**: Use these in production. Transactions made with live keys process real payments.

Each type has two components:

- **App Id**: Safe to include in client-side code (like JavaScript running in the browser).
- **App Secret**: Must be kept confidential and only used in server-side code.

## Obtaining API Keys

To obtain your API keys:

1. Log in to your [Merchant Portal](https://portal.izipay.ao)
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Client Apps**
3. You'll see your test and live API Keys

<Warning>
    Never share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, or in your browser.
</Warning>

## Using API Keys

Use your secret key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://api.izilink.com/v1/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_abcdef123456"
```

## Environment Switching

To switch between test and live environments, simply use the corresponding API keys. Your code doesn't need to change.

<CodeGroup>

    ```javascript Test Environment
    const izikey = new IziPay('sk_test_abcdef123456');
    ```

    ```javascript Live Environment
    const izikey = new IziPay('sk_live_abcdef123456');
    ```

</CodeGroup>

## API Key Security

Here are some best practices for keeping your API keys secure:

1. **Never expose secret keys**: Keep your secret keys on your server, never in client-side code or mobile apps.
2. **Use environment variables**: Store API keys in environment variables, not in your code.
3. **Restrict API key access**: Use IP restrictions and permissions to limit what each key can do.
4. **Rotate keys regularly**: Periodically generate new API keys and deprecate old ones.
5. **Monitor usage**: Regularly check your API logs for suspicious activity.

## Example: Storing API Keys Securely

<CodeGroup>

    ```javascript Node.js
    // .env file
    IZIPAY_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_abcdef123456

    // server.js
    require('dotenv').config();
    const IziPay = require('izipay-js');
    const izipay = new IziPay(process.env.IZIPAY_SECRET_KEY);
    ```

    ```python Python
    # .env file
    IZIPAY_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_abcdef123456

    # app.py
    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    from izipay import IziPay

    load_dotenv()
    izipay = IziPay(os.environ.get('IZIPAY_SECRET_KEY'))
    ```

    ```php PHP
    // .env file
    IZIPAY_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_abcdef123456

    // index.php
    <?php
    require 'vendor/autoload.php';
    $dotenv = Dotenv\Dotenv::createImmutable(__DIR__);
    $dotenv->load();

    $izilink = new \IziPay\IziPay($_ENV['IZIPAY_SECRET_KEY']);
    ```
