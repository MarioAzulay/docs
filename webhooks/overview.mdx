# Overview

Callback notifications (also known as webhooks) allow merchants to receive real-time updates when payments are successfully processed through IZI Pay. Instead of continuously polling the API for transaction updates, your system can automatically receive notifications when a payment is completed.

## How Callbacks Work

1. Your system registers a public callback URL where IZI Pay will send notifications.
2. When a payment is successfully processed, IZI Pay sends an HTTP `POST` request to your callback URL.
3. Your server processes the notification and updates your system accordingly.

## Setting Up Callbacks

To set up a callback endpoint:

1. Define a publicly accessible URL where you want to receive notifications (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/callback`).
2. Ensure your endpoint is capable of handling `POST` requests with JSON payloads.
3. Implement authentication to verify incoming requests.
4. Register the callback URL within the IZI Pay system.

## Callback Request Structure

IZI Pay sends payment notifications as HTTP `POST` requests with a JSON payload. Below is an example of the callback request format:

### HTTP Headers:
```json
{
  "access-key": "your-authentication-key",
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

### JSON Payload:
```json
{
  "idTransacao": "00000",
  "numLogSistema": "04795451",
  "idLogSistema": "7219",
  "dataTransaccaoCliente": "2022-09-08T15:53:46.0000000",
  "montantePago": 500.00,
  "tipoTerminal": "M",
  "iIdentTerminal": "0000000000",
  "localidadeTerminal": "Internet",
  "refPagamento": "871704668",
  "Id": "450610e8-942c-4760-b1d3-185073f35736"
}
```

## Callback Response Structure

Your server should respond to IZI Pay's callback request with the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "Success": true,
  "Obs": "xxxxxx",
  "Id": "xxxxxxx"
}
```
<Tip>
    - Success: Indicates if the callback was processed successfully.
    - Obs: Any additional observations or messages.
    - Id: The payment ID.
</Tip>


## Handling Callback Notifications

When your system receives a callback notification from IZI Pay, follow these best practices:

1. **Validate the Request:** Verify the `access-key` in the request header to ensure authenticity.
2. **Process the Data:** Update your system with the transaction details (e.g., marking a payment as successful).
3. **Respond with a 2xx Status Code:** Send an HTTP `200 OK` response to acknowledge receipt. If IZI Pay does not receive a successful response, it will retry the request.

## Callback Retries

If your server does not respond with a `2xx` status code, IZI Pay will retry the callback using an exponential backoff strategy:

- **1st retry:** 5 minutes after the original attempt
- **2nd retry:** 30 minutes after the 1st retry
- **3rd retry:** 2 hours after the 2nd retry
- **4th retry:** 5 hours after the 3rd retry
- **5th retry:** 10 hours after the 4th retry

<Warning>
    After the 5th attempt, IZI Pay will stop trying to deliver the callback.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

- **Secure Your Endpoint:** Use authentication mechanisms to verify requests.
- **Log All Incoming Requests:** Maintain logs for debugging and reconciliation.
- **Ensure High Availability:** Make sure your callback URL is highly available to receive notifications.
- **Handle Duplicate Notifications Gracefully:** IZI Pay may send the same event multiple times in case of failures.

## Next Steps

- Implement your callback endpoint using the provided structure.
- Test notifications using IZI Pay's sandbox or test mode.
- Monitor callback logs to ensure proper handling and troubleshooting.

<Tip>
    By integrating callback notifications, merchants can automate payment processing workflows efficiently and securely.
