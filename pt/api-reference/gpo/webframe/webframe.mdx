# Webframe Integration

The Webframe is a pre-built payment interface that can be embedded into your application to handle payment processing securely. This guide explains how to integrate and use the webframe in your application.

## Overview

The webframe integration follows these steps:

1. Generate a purchase token using the [Get Purchase Token](/api-reference/gpo/webframe/get-purchase-token) endpoint
2. Embed the webframe in your application using the URL provided in the response
3. Handle the callback and return URL events to process the payment result

## Integration Methods

### iFrame Integration

You can embed the webframe as an iFrame in your web application:

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://gpo-sandbox.izipay.ao/webframe?token=YOUR_TOKEN" 
  width="100%" 
  height="600px" 
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

### Redirect Integration

Alternatively, you can redirect the user to the webframe URL:

```javascript
window.location.href = "https://gpo-sandbox.izipay.ao/webframe?token=YOUR_TOKEN";
```

## Handling Callbacks

The webframe will send payment results to two URLs:

1. **callbackUrl**: Server-to-server notification with payment result
2. **returnUrl**: Where the customer is redirected after completing the payment process

### Callback Payload

The callback will include the following information:

```json
{
  "transactionId": "TRX123456789",
  "merchantReferenceNumber": "ORDER12345",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "amount": 1000.00,
  "currency": "AOA",
  "paymentMethod": {
    "type": "MOBILE",
    "mobile": {
      "phoneNumber": "923456789"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:30:45Z"
}
```

## Customization Options

The webframe appearance can be customized by adding parameters to the token generation request:

```json
{
  "customization": {
    "primaryColor": "#3498db",
    "logoUrl": "https://example.com/logo.png",
    "merchantName": "Display Name",
    "language": "pt"
  }
}
```

## Testing

For testing purposes, you can use the following test credentials:

| Payment Method | Test Credentials |
|----------------|------------------|
| Mobile Money   | Phone: 923456789, PIN: 1234 |
| Card           | Card Number: 4111 1111 1111 1111, Expiry: 12/25, CVV: 123 |

## Security Considerations

- Always validate the callback payload by verifying the transaction with the [Query Transaction](/api-reference/gpo/transactions/query-transaction) endpoint
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Do not store sensitive payment information in your application

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Token expired | Generate a new token |
| Invalid parameters | Check the required parameters in the token generation request |
| Callback not received | Verify the callbackUrl is accessible and properly configured |
